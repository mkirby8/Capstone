Capstone Project for Valencia College Spring 2022

Creating an online shopping application.

Project requirements: The online shopping website will have the ability to shop for clothing (shirts, pants, sweaters, shorts). ----- It should have two categories (men, women). ----- It should have the following sizes for both categories (small, medium, large, xtra large). ----- The website should have a log-in screen (login and signup). ----- It should have a screen for the shopping cart. ----- Once the order is placed, it should have a confirmation page.

All data from the website once the order is placed should be stored in the database. ----- The database will store the customer login information, order history, and inventory for the website. ----- It will connect to the website and the Java or C application.

The Java or C application will be able to retrieve information from the database. ----- It will have a menu to produce print all the customers and their login information. ----- Order history for each user (personalized by each user. Do not print all users and order history at once).

All code should be stored on a repository.

The application needs to be deployed on a server (cloud or local machine).

The Java or C application must be deployed for me to run (Executable file. I will not open an IDE to run it).

Individual Elements: Element 1: User interface (Front end) - Website (Built in HTML and CSS).

Element 2: Database - This database has to be connected to your application/website and can be developed in SQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.. (No Access Database).

Element 3: Programming Language (Back End) - The program must use either C or Java to run in the back end.

Element 4: The application must be deployed on a server located in the cloud, personal computer, or other web service.

Element 5: Use a repository to store all code. An example of a repository is Git Hub.

Element 6: Use a project management tool to track all assigned tasks and to track the progress of the application.
